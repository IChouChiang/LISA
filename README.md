# L.I.S.A. - Long Interval Sitting Alert (AI Posture Guardian)

L.I.S.A. is an intelligent posture monitoring system designed to prevent long-term sitting health issues. It uses computer vision to track user presence and an AI-powered backend to provide varied, human-like reminders to take a break.

## 🚀 Project Structure & Logic

The system is divided into three core modules:

### **Module A: The Eye (Frontend & Vision)**
*   **Technology:** HTML5, JavaScript, Google MediaPipe Pose.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Captures video from the webcam locally in the browser (privacy-first).
    *   Detects human pose landmarks to confirm if a user is present.
    *   **Privacy Mode:** By default, the video feed is hidden and replaced with a "Tech Grid" visualization of the skeleton, ensuring users don't have to stare at themselves.
    *   **UI Controls:** Offers Dark/Light/System theme syncing, Timer Pause/Resume, and Time Limit selection (10s to 1 Hour).

### **Module B: The Brain (Timer & State Logic)**
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Presence Detection:** The timer only increments when a user is detected in the frame.
    *   **Auto-Pause:** If the user leaves, the timer pauses automatically.
    *   **Auto-Reset:** If the user leaves *after* an alert has been triggered (implying they took a break), the timer automatically resets to 0 when they return.
    *   **Alert System:**
        *   **Visual:** The status text turns red.
        *   **Notification:** A system notification fires every 10 seconds after the limit is reached.
        *   **Audio:** The browser speaks a message generated by the AI every 60 seconds.

### **Module C: The Voice (Backend & AI)**
*   **Technology:** Go (Golang), DeepSeek API.
*   **Port:** Runs on `localhost:8081`.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Acts as a bridge between the Frontend and the LLM.
    *   Receives `POST` requests from the frontend when the sitting limit is reached.
    *   Calls the **DeepSeek API** to generate a short, creative, and non-repetitive health warning (e.g., "Your back will thank you for a stretch!").
    *   Returns the text to the frontend, where `window.speechSynthesis` vocalizes it.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

1.  **Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the `backend` folder.
    *   Run `go run main.go`.
    *   Ensure it is listening on port **8081**.

2.  **Frontend:**
    *   Open `posture-demo/index.html` in a modern web browser.
    *   Allow Camera and Notification permissions.

3.  **Operation:**
    *   Select a time limit (e.g., 30 Minutes).
    *   Work normally. L.I.S.A. will watch over you.
    *   When the time is up, you will hear a voice and see a notification.
    *   Stand up and leave the camera view to reset the timer automatically.

## 🔒 Privacy Note
All video processing happens **locally** on your device via MediaPipe. No video data is ever sent to the backend or the cloud. Only a text signal ("User sat for X seconds") is sent to the backend to trigger the AI response.
